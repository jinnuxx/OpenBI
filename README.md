# OpenBI
The OpenBI project was developed collaboratively with five teammates as a course assignment. It focuses on the development of an intelligent data analytics platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically generate visualisations and detailed analysis reports.

# Aims
Generalization of data analysis: OpenBI aims to make data analysis more broadly
accessible to a wide range of audience groups. The platform enables users from different
professions to effectively analyze data for different purposes.

Improving Excel Analytics: OpenBI is dedicated to improving the analytical skills of
executives, managers, employees and students from different professions. The platform
provides users with analytical tools to make decisions.

Simplify the process: OpenBI is designed to simplify the process of analyzing data.
Users only need to provide the raw data set and define the analysis objectives. The
artificially intelligent system then automatically generates visualizations and detailed
analysis reports, saving time.

Versatility: OpenBI is designed to be versatile and suitable for a variety of scenarios,
including analyzing sales revenue, website usage trends, and more. The versatility of
the platform ensures the usefulness of openBI.
