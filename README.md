# OpenBI
The OpenBI project focuses on the development of an intelligent data analytics platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically generate visualisations and detailed analysis reports.

#Aims
• Generalization of data analysis: OpenBI aims to make data analysis more broadly
accessible to a wide range of audience groups. The platform enables users from different
professions to effectively analyze data for different purposes.
• Improving Excel Analytics: OpenBI is dedicated to improving the analytical skills of
executives, managers, employees and students from different professions. The platform
provides users with analytical tools to make decisions.
• Simplify the process: OpenBI is designed to simplify the process of analyzing data.
Users only need to provide the raw data set and define the analysis objectives. The
OpenBI 5
artificially intelligent system then automatically generates visualizations and detailed
analysis reports, saving time.
• Versatility: OpenBI is designed to be versatile and suitable for a variety of scenarios,
including analyzing sales revenue, website usage trends, and more. The versatility of
the platform ensures the usefulness of openBI.
